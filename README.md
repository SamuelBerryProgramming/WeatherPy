# WeatherPy
Demonstration of OpenWeather and Google APIs. Random coordinates were generated for cities around the world, then they were used to search OpenWeather's API for weather information. Those locations were filtered based on user desired temperatures, then 4 cities were selected for a travel itinerary and mapped using Google APIs.
